        The panel titled “Better Payments with BSV” was moderated by CoinGeek’s
        Patrick Thompson, Centbee’s Lorien Gamaroff, MoneySwipe’s Kumaraguru
        Ramanujam, HandCash Co-founder Rafa Jimenez, and Centi’s Bernhard Müller
        being the panelists. The question many outside Bitcoin ask is why turn
        to BSV while they already have a Visa card, or they can make payments
        through Apple Pay, Venmo, and the rest. The very low costs of BSV
        payments and the inherent traceability on the BSV blockchain are two of
        the biggest reasons to hop on Bitcoin, Lorien noted. His company,
        Centbee, has been among the leading BSV payments platforms, allowing
        users, most of them young people, to pay at major outlets without
        converting their Bitcoin to fiat. MoneySwipe’s target is a bit
        different. Ramanujam tells the audience that he wants to change the
        remittance landscape, especially in his homeland of India, the world’s
        largest remittance destination. Last year, the country, which is home to
        17% of the world’s population, received $87 billion in remittances, but
        the fees to the consumers are still way too high. The panelists noted
        that with Bitcoin SV’s massive scaling, very low fees, and real-time
        transactions, a new world of opportunities and business models has
        opened up. With micropayments, for instance, pay-per-use becomes a real
        possibility. And as Ramanujam pointed out, Bitcoin SV can also be used
        as a backend network on which stablecoins, which are regulatory
        compliant, are issued and settled.
